*CartoonNetwork.R* file define the regulatory network comprising three nodes *A*,*B* and *C* shown in Figure 1 from the book Chapter.

*SQUADImplementation.R* file exemplifies the simulation of the regulatory network model defined in the *CartoonNetwork.R* file, first as a boolean regulatory network model and later as a continuous regulatory network using the SQUAD method.
