#SQUAD Book chapter

This project exemplifies the implementation of the Standardized Qualitative Analysis of Dynamics (SQUAD) method.

*CartoonNetwork.R* file define the regulatory network comprising three nodes *A*,*B* and *C* shown in Figure 1 from the book Chapter.

*SQUADTransformation.ipynb* file exemplifies the simulation of the regulatory network model defined in the *CartoonNetwork.R* file, first as a boolean regulatory network model, and then as a continuous regulatory network using the SQUAD method. 

*SQUAD_implementation.ipynb* contains a tutorial for implementing node perturbations with the SQUAD methodology. It presents the code used to make the figure 5.

*animation.gif* shows an animation of the figure 3 that allows to see the direction of the flow of the states of the network at different rotation angles.
